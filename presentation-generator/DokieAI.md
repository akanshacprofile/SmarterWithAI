# Dokie AI
While working on a new AI product ideation, once I had all my data points ready, I started working on a powerpoint presentation. This is a time taking job, find the correct template, find significant graphics, use gifs, try make it interactive, etc.
ChatGPT does not create a PPT for you, canva was not creating it the way I wanted it to, so I started looking for ways I can create a PPT fast, interactive, and presentable.
Thanks when I came across Dokie AI.

# Pain points Dokie AI is addressing
1. **Inefficient and Time-Consuming Presentation Creation** - It often takes hours to produce professional-looking presentation.
2. **Static, Unengaging Presentations** - Various tools only create "flat" or static slides, failing to grab attention.
3. **Rigid and Hard-to-Edit AI Content** - Editing AI-generated slides breaks the layout, requiring significant time to fix fonts and spacing.
4. **Poor Brand Consistency** - Decks often look generic and do not match company branding, leading to manual, time-consuming corrections.
5. **Limited Creativity for Non-Designers** - Creating engaging, visual-heavy, and interactive content requires, but often lacks, design skills.

# Dokie's Solution
1. It acts as an "AI PPT Maker" that generates high-quality, professional, and interactive slides in minutes rather than hours, streamlining workflows for pitch decks, internal reports, and training materials.
2. The tool focuses on creating interactive presentations that feature embedded 3D models, clickable elements, video, and animation.  
3. Dokie offers conversational, "true-to-content" editing that adapts to changes without breaking the design, allowing users to tweak layouts and structures while maintaining consistent formatting.
4. It supports custom templates, ensuring all presentations stay on-brand.  
5. Dokie aims to eliminate the post-generation cleanup stage by focusing on quality and control during the initial creation.
6. It allows users to easily add complex elements like 3D models and interactive X-rays without needing advanced design skills.

# Core Technology
- Dokie AI uses advanced large language models (LLMs) and Generative AI algorithms to automatically generate, structure, and design presentation slides from text prompts or documents.
- It focuses on content-aligned design, automatically creating logical, professional layouts and allowing for conversational editing. 
- There isn’t any public, official documentation from Dokie AI that specifies exactly which underlying large language model, algorithm, or core neural architecture they run as of early 2026. The company does not disclose those technical details on its website or press releases.
- What’s publicly known is that Dokie AI’s product relies on natural language processing (NLP) to understand user input and convert it into structured, logical slide content. It also applies machine learning to organize, summarize, and reorder material for presentation logic.
- While the exact model isn’t detailed, tools like Dokie AI typically sit on top of a foundation LLM or similar generative model that can interpret text and produce summaries or structured outputs. However, the company does not publish which model it uses.
